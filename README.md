# Schools District Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of this school district project is to aggregate the data and showcases trends in school performance using variaty of data sources [Resources](https://github.com/intisarkhalil/School_District_Analysis.git). This analysis will assist the school board superintendent in making decision regarding the school budgets and priorities analyze data on student’s funding and student’s standardized test of math and reading scores, as well as varies information on their schools.  According to potential academic dishonesty among a group of students, we repeat the analysis to find the evidence that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders changed. We use **Pyson 3.7** as a development inviroment and **Anaconda** Packadge and **Jupyter NoteBook** interface for the analysis.  
## Results: 
The findings and insights in this report are presented by comparing the results of the first full-data study and the results of the second study when we replaced the 9th grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School.

### The Effect on the District Summary:
The following two images showcases that replacing of the nine-grade student’s math and reding score from Thomas high school affected the average math and reding scores as well as the % of passing math and reading and the overall percentage of passing. We present the results to 2-decimal places to show the differences.
